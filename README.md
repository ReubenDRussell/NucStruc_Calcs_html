# NucStruc_Calcs_html
Nuclear Structure Calculators (html versions)
html versions of the python calculators. Should work the same as them.
Again, remember to check first with "known" values.

The code itself is not going to be of great beauty, since I learned the python GUI crap in an afternoon then learned html on a friday afternoon. The bulk was completed in a week from the first idea.
